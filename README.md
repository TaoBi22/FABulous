## Introduction
FABulous is designed to fulfill the objectives of ease of use, maximum portability to different process nodes, good control for customization, and delivering good area, power, and performance characteristics of the generated FPGA fabrics. The framework provides templates for logic, arithmetic, memory, and I/O blocks that can be easily stitched together, whilst enabling users to add their own fully customized blocks and primitives.

The FABulous ecosystem generates the embedded FPGA fabric for chip fabrication, integrates 
[SymbiFlow](https://symbiflow.github.io/) 
toolchain release packages, deals with the bitstream generation and after fabrication tests. Additionally, we will provide an emulation path for system development.

This guide describes everything you need to set up your system to develop for FABulous ecosystem.

Ways to run Symbiflow on these devices will be explained in the near future.

## Prerequisites
The following packages need to be installed for generating fabric HDLs
 - Python 3.5 or later

Install python dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The following packages need to be installed for CAD toolchain
 - [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
 - FABulous' nextpnr fork (covered in instructions below)

## Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous
cd FABulous
git clone --branch fabulous https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/nextpnr
cd nextpnr
cmake . -DARCH=fabulous
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

The fabric generator flow can be run using bash scripts based on the examples provided under ```/fabric_files```.

Before you run the flow for the first time, you must generate the basic files using the following commands:
```
cd fabric_generator
./create_basic_files.sh ../fabric_files/generic/fabric.csv
```
Then use the following command to build the entire FPGA fabric in both VHDL and Verilog:
```
./run_fab_flow.sh
```
You are now ready to emulate or synthesise with the netlists in ```/vhdl_output``` or ```/verilog_output```.

A simple example that runs to generate bitstream can be found under ```nextpnr/fabulous/fab_arch/```

Usage example:

```
cd ../nextpnr/fabulous/fab_arch/
./fabulous_flow.sh sequential_16bit_en
python3 bit_gen.py -genBitstream sequential_16bit_en.fasm meta_data.txt sequential_16bit_en_output.bin
```
More details on bitstream generation can be found [here](https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous/tree/master/fabric_generator/bitstream_npnr).
